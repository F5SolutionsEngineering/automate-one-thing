An A1T workshop is typically a 1-2 days engagement at a customerâ€™s office or via Zoom. The workshop focuses on the identified business pain point and addresses this pain point through the automation of F5 products.

## Example Agenda
Day 1:
- Account team, A1T team, and the customer will host kickoff meeting (1-2 hours)
- A1T team, FSE, and the customer will start working on identified tasks (3-4 hours)
- A1T team will demo a solution or provide an update on outstanding tasks (1 hour)

Day 2 (if needed):
- A1T team, FSE, and the customer will continue working on identified tasks
- A1T team will demo solution

## Technical Background
Each A1T workshop can be different from another. To help cover a wide variety of functions, it is best if the members of the A1T team possess the following skills:

- Deployment of BIG-IP in AWS and Azure via native template solution ([CFT](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-aws-cloudformation) and [ARM](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-azure-arm-templates))
- Provisioning a BIG-IP via [Terraform]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/tools/terraform.html)
- Configuration of a BIG-IP via [Ansible]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/tools/ansible.html)
- Proficent knowledge of the [Automation Toolchain](https://www.f5.com/products/automation-and-orchestration), specifically [Declarative Onboarding](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-declarative-onboarding/latest/) and [AS3](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-appsvcs-templates/latest/)
- Agile processes with an emphasis on the creation of user stories and tasks

## Backlog 
After the A1T workshop, it is common for a few backlog items to remain.  Thes issues were identified during the kickoff meeting. Still, they were not essential to the completion of the defined tasks during the sprint timebox. These items, as well as moving the A1T workshop deliverable into production, are part of the recommended follow-up cadence.

## Follow-up
Ideally, A1T workshops should have a 30-day and 60-day follow-up scheduled with the customer to check:

- status of moving the workshop deliverable into production
- status of remaining backlog items

You can also use the follow-up meetings to identify if additional engagement, like F5 Professional Services, would be useful to continue the ball rolling on their automation journey.
