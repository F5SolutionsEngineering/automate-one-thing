description: "Chef InSpec is an open-source framework for testing and auditing your applications and infrastructure. Chef InSpec works by comparing the actual state of your system with the desired state that you express in easy-to-read and easy-to-write Chef InSpec code. Chef InSpec detects violations and displays findings in the form of a report, but puts you in control of remediation."

In the A1T workshops, we use InSpec to validate that our deployments are ready and achieved the desired outcome.  This can be as simple as ensuring the F5 Automation Toolchain is installed and running the right versions or as complex as ensuring the BIG-IP and the application is available in multiple regions.

For some common examples used in A1T workshops, check out Mark Menger's [InSpec BIG-IP repository](https://github.com/mjmenger/inspec-bigip).
