description: "Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows."

In the A1T workshops, we try to use the customer's Git repository of choice.  If they do not have a Git solution then we fallback to a GitHub.com repository.  For the most part, the work we do in the workshop leverages standard Git features so any hosted Git solution will work.
