A1T workshops are delivered by F5 Solutions Engineers and Solutions Architects to help customers automate a business-impacting task in a non-production environment.  The outcome of a workshop is a solution the customer can take into production and show immediate benefits to their company.

A1T workshops are delivered in an agile fashion with a 2-day sprint.  The workshop starts with the customer and F5 teams identifying the resources and tools needed. Then the teams break the defined pain point into user stories and tasks.
